## Introduction

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, involving the identification and localization of objects within an image. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to perform object detection, providing accurate and efficient results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- `models/`: Pre-trained and trained models.
- `results/`: Output images and performance metrics.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sparks-foundation-object-detection.git
   cd sparks-foundation-object-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the object detection model, use the following command:

```bash
python src/detect.py --input data/sample_image.jpg --output results/output_image.jpg
```

For video input, use:

```bash
python src/detect.py --input data/sample_video.mp4 --output results/output_video.mp4
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes images with annotated bounding boxes for various object classes. You can download the dataset from [here](#).

## Model Training

To train the object detection model, use the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --data data/train --epochs 50 --batch-size 16
```

## Results

The results of the object detection model are stored in the `results/` directory.
